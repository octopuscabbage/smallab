# smallab
:small_blue_diamond: :microscope: :small_blue_diamond:

smallab (Small Lab) is an experiment framework designed to be easy to use with your experiment. 

The code in this repo should be understandable as a whole in at most 10 minutes.
![](https://github.com/octopuscabbage/smallab/blob/master/smallab.gif)

## Features

* Easy to understand and simple
* Easy parallelization of experiments
* Only runs not previously completed experiments
* Hooks allow monitoring batch progress
* All parameters to methods use the typing module
* Dashboard for monitoring experiment progress

## Installation

`pip install smallab`

or clone here from source

#What you need to import from smallab
from smallab.experiment_types.experiment import Experiment

#Write a simple experiment

    #Need to implement this method, will be passed the specification
    #Return a dictionary of results
    def main(self, specification: typing.Dict) -> typing.Dict:
        random.seed(specification["seed"])
        for i in range(specification["num_calls"]): #Advance the random number generator some amount

        if "fail" in specification and specification["fail"]:
            raise Exception()
        return {"number":random.random()}

runner.attach_callbacks([EmailCallbackBatchOnly("test@test.com",40)])
#Take it back off since we don't actually want to bother Mr. Test

#Set the specifications for our experiments, the author reccomends reading this from a json file!

#Fire off the experiment

#Read back our results

                print(results["specification"]["seed"])
                print(results["result"]["number"])


from smallab.specification_generator import SpecificationGenerator
#If you want to run a lot of experiments but not manual write out each one, use the specification generator.
#Note: This is also JSON serializable, so you could store this in a json file

#Call the generate method. Will create the cross product.
specifications = SpecificationGenerator().generate(generation_specification)
print(specifications)

runner.run("random_number_from_generator",specifications,SimpleExperiment(),continue_from_last_run=True)

#Read back our results

                print(results["specification"]["seed"])
                print(results["result"]["number"])

#If you have an experiment you want run on a lot of computers you can use the MultiComputerGenerator
#You assign each computer a number from 0..number_of_computers-1 and it gives each computer every number_of_computerth specification
from smallab.specification_generator import MultiComputerGenerator
all_specifications = SpecificationGenerator().from_json_file('test.json')

g1 = MultiComputerGenerator(0,2)
g2 = MultiComputerGenerator(1,2)

assert len(specifications_1) + len(specifications_2) == len(all_specifications)

#Need to freeze the sets in order to do set manipulation on dictionaries
specifications_1 = set([frozenset(sorted(x.items())) for x in specifications_1])
specifications_2 = set([frozenset(sorted(x.items())) for x in specifications_2])
all_specifications = set([frozenset(sorted(x.items())) for x in all_specifications])

#This will generate two disjoint sets of specifications
assert specifications_1.isdisjoint(specifications_2)
#That together make the whole specification
assert specifications_1.union(specifications_2) == all_specifications



#You can use the provided logging callbacks to log completion and failure of specific specifcations
from smallab.utilities import logger_callbacks
runner.attach_callbacks([LoggingCallback()])
runner.run('with_logging',SpecificationGenerator().from_json_file("test.json"),SimpleExperiment(),continue_from_last_run=True)
```

## How it works
The `ExperimentRunner` class is passed a list of dictionaries of specifications. 
These dictionaries need to be json serializable.

The `ExperimentRunner` looks at the `completed.json` in the folder for the batch name (the name parameter of the `.run` method) and computes which experiments need to be run. 
The experiments that need to run are the specifications not in the `completed.json`.

The `ExperimentRunner` begins runnning the batch either in parallel or single threaded. 
If the parallel implementation is used each specification is `joblib`'s threaded backend. 

Once all experiments are either completed or failed (they threw an exception) the results are saved as a `pickle` file. 
The results are saved in a dictionary that looks like 
```python
{
    "specification": <the specification the experiment was passed>,
    "result": <what the experiment .main returned>
}
```

The return value of the experiment `.main` function must be `pickle` serializable. 

### Callbacks
The runner has several hooks which are called at different times. 

* `on_specification_complete` called whenever a specification completes running (Ususually a single experiment)
* `on_specification_falure` called whenver a specification fails running (Throws an exception)
* `on_batch_complete` called after runner `.run` has finished running, passed all the succesfully completed specifications
* `on_batch_failure` called after runner `.run` has finished running, passed all the failed specifications


### Folder Structure
Each experiment is saved in the following structure

```
experiment_runs/
  <name>/                        # The name you provide to runner.run
    <specification_hash>/        # A hash of the dictionary you provide as the specification
      specification.json         # The specification.json
        <specification_hash>.pkl # The results dictionary
```
